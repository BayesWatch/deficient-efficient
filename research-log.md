This research follows on from research done on ACDC transforms and training
networks incorporated them into the convolutional layers, with the goal of
efficiency. That research log is found [here][acdc]

In this repository we're going to be comparing various other methods using
low-rank approximations to the full-rank random matrices typically used in
deep learning. There were some simple tricks that made the training of ACDC
convolutional layers possible:

1. Set an appropriate weight decay.
2. Use distillation.
3. Ensure initialisation maintains the properties of common deep learning
random initialisation strategies.

Currently, we have only added HashedNets to the implemented layers, and
they need to use separable layers (current implementation does not). The
implementation of ACDC layers is separable, so it is required for a level
playing field. Also, it's a standard choice to improve efficiency anyway.

After implementing the current full convolution HashedNet layers, tested
them with a WRN-28-10 and a teacher that achieves 3.3% top 1 error on
CIFAR-10. Strangely, the network trained without a teacher worked better,
achieving a final top-1 error of 6.48%. The student network converged to
7.47%.

The training loss converges to zero in the case of the network trained
without a teacher. Student networks typically don't converge to zero; the
attention transfer loss is hard to minimise.

The overfitting here is not bad, similar to experiments with traditional
networks:
